      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h2>Shantelle Pace – Graphic Design Student </h2>
      <p>My name is Shantelle Pace, and I’m a 19-year-old full-time student currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design. I have a passion for visual storytelling and creative expression, and I’m especially drawn to Adobe Photoshop. It’s my favorite design tool because it allows for fast, efficient image editing and retouching. With its powerful features—such as preset filters, customizable brushes, and layered editing—the more I use it, the more fluent and intuitive it becomes.This website serves as a digital portfolio to showcase my creative work. It’s a space where others can explore my designs, find inspiration, and learn more about my style and journey. It also acts as a professional reference point for future opportunities and collaborations.Summer is my favorite season—not only because of the free time it gives me to experiment with new ideas, but also because I enjoy traveling and discovering new cultures, which often inspire my designs.</p>
